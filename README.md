# Drone-Image-Restoration-and-Semantic-Segmentation
Developed a multi-modal drone image processing pipeline that leverages auxiliary sensor data to perform image restoration using iterative Richardson–Lucy deconvolution and adaptive contrast normalization followed by object detection.

Applied texture-based semantic segmentation with Laws energy features for terrain classification and performed object localization through post-processing of segmentation masks using morphological operations and connected-component analysis.
